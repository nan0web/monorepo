# NaN0Web – decentralized‑crypto‑anarchic platform

## Overview

**NaN0Web** is an open project that brings together the philosophy of free people, programming logic and the Ukrainian language.  
The network guarantees **data ownership** for their creators and communication with language models in Ukrainian, which enhances transparency and security.

## Historical context

- In 2014 the author moved from Zaporizhzhia to Lviv to study the Ukrainian language and culture, realizing that language shapes thinking and that Ukrainian is logical and not corrupted by imperial traditions.  
- After the aggression/war it became clear that the fight against imperialism starts with language: language shapes thought and everyday life, and nothing good has ever come from Russian in this respect.  
- Information is the highest value produced by a person.  
- The importance of information ownership: **data and knowledge must stay with the owner**, not with social networks that claim the right to delete or block that data.

## Philosophy

1. **Freedom of language** – Ukrainian does not impose imperial names (e.g., month names) and allows precise formulation of ideas.  
2. **Freedom of code** – code is open, available to every conscious person, without restrictions.  
3. **Data ownership** – information belongs to its creator; the platform does not collect or monetize data from third‑party services.  
4. **Decentralization‑crypto‑anarchy** – the network operates without centralized servers, using cryptographic protocols for protection and authentication.  
5. **Transparency = security** – open source code lets anyone audit, fix vulnerabilities and provide quantum‑resistance.

## Why the Ukrainian language?

Ukrainian has a clear grammar and structure that enables logical statements without unnecessary metaphors. Unlike Russian, it does not distort logic and is not tied to imperial names. A good example is month names, which in Ukrainian are based on natural phenomena rather than on the names of emperors or gods.

### Example of month names

| English | Ukrainian | Russian |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| January | Січень | Январь |
| February | Лютий | Февраль |
| March (God of war) | Березень | Март (Бог войны) |
| April | Квітень | Апрель |
| May | Травень | Май |
| June | Червень | Июнь |
| July (Emperor) | Липень | Июль (император) |
| August (Emperor) | Серпень | Август (император) |
| September (7) | Вересень | Сентябрь (7) |
| October (8) | Жовтень | Октябрь (8) |
| November (9) | Листопад | Ноябрь (9) |
| December (10) | Грудень | Декабрь (10) |

## Platform architecture

- **Language models** – interact in Ukrainian at the instruction level, ensuring accuracy and comprehensibility.  
- **NaN0Web packages** – a modular system that includes Core, Browser/Mobile, React components and others.  
- **Testing** – 100 % coverage with unit tests (`node:test`), `vitest` for React, and a **Playground** for automated demonstrations.  
- **Typing** – JavaScript typedefs are compiled into pure TypeScript `d.ts` files, providing IDE autocomplete.  
- **Documentation** – generated from tests, available in Ukrainian and English.

## Decentralized crypto‑anarchic network

- **Blockchain support** – data is encrypted and stored across distributed nodes, preventing censorship.  
- **Quantum resistance** – modern post‑quantum algorithms are integrated, preparing for future threats.  
- **Transparent protocol** – open APIs allow anyone to connect their services without central control.

## Data ownership

1. **Copyright** – data remains with its creator.  
2. **Access control** – users decide who can read or modify data via decentralized ACLs.  
3. **Openness** – data can be linked to other networks through open protocols without losing ownership.

## Security and transparency

- **Open source** – anyone can audit, fix vulnerabilities and improve security.  
- **Publicness** – publishing the code is the best defense: no hidden intentions, no “black boxes”.  
- **Quantum resistance** – preparation for future computational threats through post‑quantum cryptographic schemes.

## Open‑source

The project is licensed under **ISC**, allowing free use, modification and distribution in any format. Open code provides the highest level of security, as errors are quickly discovered and fixed by the community.

## How to get involved

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nan0web/monorepo.git
   cd monorepo
   pnpm install   # or npm / yarn
   ```
2. **Run the Playground**  
   ```bash
   pnpm play   # automated examples
   ```
3. **Run the tests**  
   ```bash
   pnpm test:all
   ```
4. **Create new packages** – following the `nan0package` template (`src/`, `test/`, `play/`, `README.md`).

## License

The project is distributed under the **ISC** license.
